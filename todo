FizzBuzz: A classic introductory problem that involves printing numbers and substituting multiples of 3 and 5 with "Fizz" and "Buzz," respectively.

Palindrome Detection: Write a program to determine whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

Anagram Detection: Determine if two given strings are anagrams of each other.

Factorial Calculation: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number both iteratively and recursively.

Fibonacci Sequence: Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number, either using recursion or iteration.

Prime Number Generation: Write a program to generate a list of prime numbers up to a given limit.

Sorting Algorithms: Implement and compare various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort.

Binary Search: Implement a binary search algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.

Linked List Operations: Create a linked list data structure and perform common operations like insertion, deletion, and reversing.

Stack and Queue Implementation: Implement a stack and a queue using arrays or linked lists, and perform basic operations on them.

Tree Traversal: Write code to traverse a binary tree in-order, pre-order, and post-order.

Graph Algorithms: Implement common graph algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Dynamic Programming: Solve classic dynamic programming problems like the Fibonacci sequence, coin change problem, and knapsack problem.

String Manipulation: Write code to perform string operations like string reversal, substring search, and character counting.

Matrix Operations: Implement matrix multiplication, transpose, and other basic matrix operations.

Recursion Practice: Solve problems that require recursive solutions, such as computing the Tower of Hanoi or solving the N-Queens problem.

Regular Expressions: Write regular expressions to match and extract specific patterns from text data.

File I/O: Create programs to read and write data to files, perform data processing, and analyze data.

Web Scraping: Write scripts to extract information from websites using libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy (Python).

API Integration: Develop applications that interact with external APIs, such as weather data, social media, or mapping services.

Database Operations: Perform database operations like creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and updating records.

Concurrency and Multithreading: Solve problems related to parallel programming, synchronization, and managing threads in a multithreaded environment.

Networking: Create programs that involve socket programming, network communication, and building client-server applications.

Data Structures: Implement data structures like hash tables, heaps, AVL trees, and more, and perform operations on them.

Machine Learning and AI Problems: If you're interested in machine learning and AI, tackle problems like image classification, text generation, or sentiment analysis.
